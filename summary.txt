SUMMARY:

- he steps through my head what is a knife first thing I want to do is give them a target that I am ok being stabbed in Tab here not good stop here.
- I know I have control when he starts to my hand that is going to damage some tendons so I stop myself again here right now I have complete control.
- He would then take it and remove it from his opponent's hand.
